# Xmlary

## Introduction
A collection of helper classes I've made to simplify my workflow when using lots of XML with php and extracted into a composer package. The primary function of the package is to generate XML from associative arrays and provide a convenient platform for encapsulating that XML generation in its own object. 

Parsing and converting data from XML to various other formats is only marginally implemented and will be expanded upon in future updates. Use those features with caution at your own risk.
